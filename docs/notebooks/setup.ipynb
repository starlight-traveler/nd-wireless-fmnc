We are forwarding the packets to their intendend destination at a latency of lower than >100 ms, and have full bandwidth to modify the packets in flight as we have access to all the appropriate headers and internals of the TCP/IP packet (theoretically UDP too, but that is not supported.)\n",

    "\n",
    "As of writing this, the latter is not implemented, however the program does send the packet \"out of order\" in a sense to mimic a similar functionality, even if the payload data block is intact, the actual packets are guranteed by TCP to be received in order -- this is what we are testing.\n",
