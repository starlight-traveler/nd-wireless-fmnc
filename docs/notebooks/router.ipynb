    "## High-Level Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of a packet processing pipeline that involves capturing packets from a network interface, processing and logging TCP information, and then reordering and sending these packets back out. The main functionalities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Packet Capture and Filtering:**  \n",
    "   Using `libpcap` (functions like `pcap_open_live`, `pcap_loop`), the code sets filters to capture packets from a specific host (`192.168.2.2`) while excluding packets originating from a particular MAC address.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example filter:  \n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   \"src host 192.168.2.2 and not ether src <some:mac:address>\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This ensures we only process packets from the desired source while ignoring potentially unwanted traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Threaded Operation and Shared Data:**  \n",
    "   Multiple threads operate on shared data structures, like a `packet_queue`, `tcp_flag_counts`, `tcp_option_counts`, and a `packet_log`. Each of these data structures is protected by mutexes to ensure thread-safe access. A `std::shared_ptr<Server::Data>` is passed around to give all threads access to these shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Packet Analysis and Modification:**\n",
    "   When a packet is received:\n",
    "   - It extracts and parses Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers.\n",
    "   - It logs TCP flags and options (for later JSON serialization).\n",
    "   - It may modify the packet headers, such as removing certain TCP options (e.g., SACK) and recalculating checksums.\n",
    "   - It stores these packets in a queue for delayed and/or reordered forwarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reordering and Sending Packets:**\n",
    "   After a certain time threshold (e.g., 1ms), the code sends all queued packets in reverse order. This simulates a scenario where packets might arrive out of order, potentially for testing network resilience or debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Serialization and Logging:**\n",
    "   Flags, options, and packet metadata are logged and periodically flushed to JSON files by a separate `serialization_manager` thread.\n",

    "## Key Complex Snippets and Their Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snippet 1: Computing Time Differences and Sending Queued Packets\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// Compute time difference in microseconds\n",
    "long time_diff_us = compute_time_difference(internal->prev_timestamp, curr_timestamp);\n",
    "\n",
    "// If first packet, time_diff_us = 0\n",
    "if (internal->prev_timestamp.tv_sec == 0 && internal->prev_timestamp.tv_usec == 0) {\n",
    "    time_diff_us = 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// If more than 1ms passed, send queued packets\n",
    "if (time_diff_us > 1000) {\n",
    "    send_queued_packets(internal);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What’s Happening:**  \n",
    "This snippet retrieves timestamps from incoming packets, computes how much time has passed since the previous packet. When that delay exceeds 1ms, it triggers the sending of all queued packets. This simulates a timing-based batch sending mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s Complex:**  \n",
    "Timing and synchronization are crucial. The code ensures that packets are only sent after a small delay, potentially to mimic network jitter or reordering conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snippet 2: Processing TCP Options and Removing SACK\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// Check for and remove SACK options in the TCP header\n",
    "if (ip_header->protocol == IPPROTO_TCP) {\n",
    "    // ... parsing options ...\n",
    "    if (sack_option_found) {\n",
    "        // Rebuild the packet without SACK options\n",
    "        // Adjust TCP header length, recalculate checksums\n",
    "        compute_tcp_checksum(ip_header, tcp_header);\n",
    "        compute_ip_checksum(ip_header);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What’s Happening:**  \n",
    "This snippet identifies if the SACK (Selective Acknowledgment) option is present in the TCP header. If found, it rebuilds the TCP options without the SACK entries. This involves careful memory manipulation, option parsing, and length adjustments. After modifying the packet, it must recompute the IP and TCP checksums to maintain packet integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s Complex:**  \n",
    "Manually parsing and modifying TCP options is error-prone. The code must carefully handle variable-length options, ensure no malformed data, and properly update all lengths and checksums.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Snippet 3: Thread-Safe Logging and Incrementing Counts\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**What’s Happening:**  \n",
    "This uses a `std::lock_guard` to ensure that increments to `tcp_flag_counts` happen without data races. Multiple threads may process packets simultaneously, so proper locking prevents corruption of shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s Complex:**  \n",
    "Multithreaded concurrency is tricky. Without locks, you risk inconsistent reads/writes. This snippet shows a simple but crucial concurrency control mechanism.\n",

    "### Snippet 4: Reversing the Packet Queue and Sending\n",
    "\n",

    "{\n",
    "    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(internal->queue_mutex);\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What’s Happening:**  \n",
    "The code acquires a lock on the queue, reverses the order of packets, sends them, and then clears the queue. Reversing is a simple way to simulate out-of-order delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s Complex:**  \n",
    "Ensuring that no other thread is manipulating the queue at the same time is essential. The lock guarantees that the reverse, send, and clear operations happen atomically. The logic is conceptually straightforward but critical for ensuring thread safety and deterministic behavior.\n"

    "   When enough payload data accumulates (exceeding `internal->window_size`):\n",
    "   - The `window()` function is called.\n",
    "   - It splits the payload data into multiple packets of random sizes (above a minimum size).\n",

    "   - Sends each packet out through the raw socket, adding delays to simulate network conditions.\n",
