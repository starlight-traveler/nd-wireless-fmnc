# **NDAIMM Main Computer Documentation**

***Notre Dame Artifical Intelligence & Machine Learning and Modeling Team***

This is the home of all the documentation for the Main LPV computer. Please review the below and go to ***Getting Started*** in order to access the programming suite.

Inspired by literate programming, maintained by the Notre Dame Artifical Intelligence team, and built with a focus on trunk-based development and industry best practices, this NDAIMM project contains comprehensive documentation, automated testing, CI/CD, and secure coding practices. Some key things to review project management wise:

- [**README**](README), [**CODE_OF_CONDUCT**](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [**CONTRIBUTING**](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

  > README files are important and often neglected. The files should inform anyone about the first steps to use, learn and contribute to your project.
  >
- [**CITATION.cff**](CITATION.cff)

  > Embracing [CFF](https://citation-file-format.github.io) aligns with best practices for reproducible research and software development. By adhering to established standards for documenting project dependencies and citations, NDAIMM demonstrates our commitment to quality, transparency, and integrity in our work.
